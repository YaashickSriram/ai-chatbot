Automation Type,Definition,Tools to be Used,Automation Strategy
API Automation,"Automating backend APIs to validate invoice processing rules, data accuracy, workflows, approvals, blocking logic, and dashboard metrics.","Playwright (Python), Pytest","API-first approach. Automate critical business rules such as invoice classification, duplicate validation, PO/Non-PO decision logic, approval routing, blocking and release logic. API tests will act as the primary regression suite and will be integrated with CI/CD pipelines."
UI Automation,"Automating critical UI workflows to validate invoice visibility, approvals, dashboards, and reports.",Playwright (Python),"UI automation will be limited to high-value scenarios such as approval actions, dashboard rendering, and report access. Avoid duplicating API validations at UI level to reduce maintenance and flakiness."
Integration Automation,"Automating validation of data flow between Sprint AP and external systems like SAP, OCR services, and Email systems.","Playwright (API), Manual validation","Focus on validating request/response contracts, data consistency, and error handling between systems. Automation will cover happy paths; complex exception cases will be manually validated initially."
Regression Automation,Automating previously validated scenarios to ensure new changes do not break existing functionality.,Playwright (Python),Maintain a stable regression suite covering core invoice lifecycle scenarios. Execute regression tests nightly and before major releases.
Smoke Automation,Automating a small set of critical test cases to validate build stability.,Playwright (Python),"Smoke tests will cover invoice ingestion, basic validation, and posting readiness. Executed on every deployment and CI build."
Data-Driven Automation,"Executing automated tests using multiple datasets across countries, invoice types, and scenarios.","Playwright (Python), JSON/CSV test data","Use external test data files to validate country-specific rules (USA, Germany, Norway), PO vs Non-PO flows, and duplicate cases without duplicating scripts."
Security / Access Automation,Automating validation of role-based access and approval authority at API level.,Playwright (API),Validate that users can access and act only on permitted invoices and approvals. Focus on negative access scenarios and role escalation prevention.
Dashboard & Reporting Automation,Automating validation of backend data powering dashboards and reconciliation reports.,Playwright (API),Validate KPI calculations and report data via APIs rather than UI wherever possible. UI checks will be limited to visual sanity validation.
